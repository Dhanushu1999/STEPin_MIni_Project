## External Libraries Used
*   [Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity) from Throw The Switch as unit test framework

## Project Dependencies

1.  GCC
2.  Make
3.  Unittest

## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome
1. Understanding of makefiles to link with code coverage,unit testing,static and dynamic analysis was a major issue mainly wrt including dependencies.
2. Initially tracing and updating project when working with both OS seemed to be difficult and it was overcome with clear understanding of linkage between vs code and github.
3.Github actions, github badges seemed difficult at first with help of study materials uploaded at futureskill platform and overcame the difficulties faced.
