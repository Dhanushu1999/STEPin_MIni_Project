## Introduction
- Employee Record Management System project used to manage the data of the employees such as personal details, education details, work exp etc. This application based on file handling in C, where file-related function like fopen, fread, fwrite, ..etc.

## Research
Traditionally,most records are maintained in a flat file in many institutions and organizations, once they were physically filed, they begin to take up valuable office space. This management typically consisted of transferring the records offsite to a records center facility or warehouse dumping ground where they were forgotten. This makes it difficult to retrieve information when they are needed and valuable information that may be needed information may be lost due to the poor practice of dumping the files and there is need for the adoption of computers to facilitate the operations of organizations. This will bring about increased productivity, better information management and faster processing of data.especially when it comes to maintaining record of indivisuals.

## Features and Benefits of project

- Effectively Retrieve and Dispose Records
- A user friendly envirounment so that the application be used by any Employee.
- Increases efficiency of data access.
- Cost effective.

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
- Newly established business which or some of the government sectors which could use this application to ease the process of recording data.

## What:
- Many organisations especially in some government sectors still use a traditional method of paper filing to store data of each employee ,which makes to hard to keep track of data with growing number of employees.

## When:
- Current where all the aspects are getting digitalized and many IT sectors are working on to record the data over cloud etc it is necessary for many companys to cope up  with growing era.

## Where:
- This project is likely to be implemented in certain government sector which follow paper filing to store data.

## How:
- The project could help individual employeee or admin to store and access information on each employee by providing username and employee_ID. This project may sometime cause issue  when it comes to storing details of large number of employee as there is no efficient ways to arrange details as a whole.
